                    <div>
                        <h3 id="balrog">Balrogs (Valaraukar)</h3>
                            <p>These creatures were originally beings, the Maiar, made to help guide the creation of the world through their gods, the Valar, and were neither meant to be inheiritly good nor bad. Early in the first-age a small group of them, three to seven, became corrupted by a Melkor or Morgoth and fell into darkness which twisted them into beings of fire and destruction. This is how they became known as the Balrogs of the second and third ages.</p>
                        <h4 id="durinsbane">Durin's Bane</h4>
                            <p>The most widely known Balrog is named Durin's Bane with it being attributed for the fall of the Mines of Moria. It eventually had a fight with the wizard Gandalf the Grey, another Maiar, in which it was finally laid to rest.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3 id="dragons">Dragons</h3>
                            <p>These were creatures who origin is widely unknown although it is known that Morgoth was behind their creation. They were viewed across the lands as being intellegent, powerful, and ancient while beings both admired and feared them.</p>
                        <h4 id="ancalagon">Ancalagon (the Black)</h4>
                            <p>While this is one of the more known dragons it should be known as one of the most dangerous. This dragon was the largest to ever exist on the planes of Middle-Earth and although his time is limited to a short period between being unleashed by Morgoth and later defeated. That doesn't make its impact any less significant as this creature was able to hold mountain tops within its grasp.</p> 
                        <h4 id="smaug">Smaug</h4>
                            <p>This was a dragon more known in the third-age as it had taken over the Dwarven mountain of Erebor. It was assumed to be the last major dragon of Middle-Earth and was later slain during its assualt on Lake Town.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h3 id="spiders">Spiders (Children of Ungoliant)</h3>
                            <p>These spiders often enhabited dark and dangerous places in the planes of Middle-Earth. Their presense was alos considered as a sign of darkness or manevolence.</p>
                        <h4 id="ungoliant">Ungoliant</h4>
                            <p>While much of her creation is still a mystery, she was known as the mother of spiders. During the first-age she joined leauges with Morgoth to consume the Two Trees of Valinor which caused her to grow to massive sizes. However, this led to her growing a hunger that was never to be sated and her death is widely attributed to her eventually devoring herself.</p>
                        <h4 id="shelob">Shelob</h4>
                            <p>She is a distant decendant of Ungoliant and was known in the third-age of Middle-Earth. It's stated that she kept to herself to lure in prey and feast to her hearts content. Later on she encounter two hobbits, Frodo and Samwise, where she was deeply injured enough to retreat for the first time and her fate is unknown.</p>
